# Pattern-Recognition using Sensors data information

Classifying motion sensor data is one of application of time series data. The project is about pattern recognition depending on  sensors data, whether a given exponent is good (1) or bad (0) based on 3 sensors called Temperature, Pressure (barometric) and Humidity. This project is done using python 3 and machine learning libraries and algorithm.
